\@doendnote{endnote31}{We refer to a system of $A$ $d$-flavour fermions with $A>d$ as $d^p \oplus \protect \tmspace  +\thinmuskip {.1667em}b$ with $p$ $d$-uplets of fermions which can share the same spatial quantum states, and $b<d$ are the residual particles which are not enough to fill the flavour degeneracy of the states. This notation exposes the number of particles not on-shell for the Pauli interaction. For example, in this notation the nuclear $^6$Li is denoted $4 \oplus \protect \tmspace  +\thinmuskip {.1667em}2$; a hypothetical system of 33 atoms of Helium-3 (spin $1/2$ fermions), $2^{16} \oplus \protect \tmspace  +\thinmuskip {.1667em} 1$;}
\@doendnote{endnote32}{This constraint changes the threshold structure significantly. Consequently, the ground states of \unhbox \voidb@x \hbox {\protect \ensuremath  {A\oplus \protect \tmspace  +\thinmuskip {.1667em}1}}\protect \nobreakspace  {}systems are not expected in the same $L_\protect \text  {total}=1$ channels. Consistently, our SVM calculations do not yield bound states for this choice of $B(3)$.}
