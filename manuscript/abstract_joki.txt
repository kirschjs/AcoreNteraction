It is shown that a fermionic system composed which interacts solely via one flavour-independent,
rotationally invariant(S-wave) two- and and one three-body regularized contact, and which
comprises one more particle than accessible internal(spin) degrees of freedom
cannot sustain a bound state if the range/support of the interaction is below a certain threshold.

This critical range is found to converge (as a function of particle number) to a minimum
more rapidly for larger ratios between a three- and a two-body binding energy which
characterize the system.
For the nuclear four-flavour system, the result $r_\text{effective}\simulleq XXX$~fm
provides a constraint for contact effective field theories of larger nuclei.
In support of the development of such theories, the effect of a finite, residual
interaction in odd-parity two-body partial waves is found to dominate over
that stemming from higher even-parity two-body partial waves on the viability
to bind the $A<XXX$-body system.

Results for these $A<9$ equal, nuclear-mass systems are obtained in microscopic $A$-body calculations.
For $A>8$, the dependence of an effective interaction between, (i), an $(A-1)$-body, spatially
symmetric bound state, and (ii), a single corpuscle, on the two- and three-body
interaction parameters is derived (single-channel, two-cluster Resonating Group).
Thereby, the minimal critical binding range of the microscopic interaction is determined for a ration
between the system-defining two- and three-body binding energies ranging from the unitary limit with
vanishing two-body bound state, to the experimental triton-deuteron value. The result allows for the
conjecture of a vanishing range in the large-flavour limit, which means, not even an infinite-range
interaction is capable to bind a fermion to a sea of equal-mass particles in which one copy of it
is embedded.
